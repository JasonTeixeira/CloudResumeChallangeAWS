![AWS Cloud Portfolio](https://github.com/JasonTeixeira/CloudResumeChallangeAWS/blob/main/AWS%20Cloud%20Portfolio.png)

**Project Summary:**

Deployed a highly available, secure, and cost-effective static website leveraging AWS services. This project demonstrates expertise in setting up serverless architecture for hosting static web content with built-in security, scalability, and monitoring capabilities.

**Technologies & Tools Used:**

- **AWS S3**: Hosted static assets (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) for optimal performance.
- **AWS CloudFront**: Integrated CDN for global content delivery with low latency.
- **AWS Route 53**: Managed custom domain and DNS routing.
- **AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)**: Provisioned SSL/TLS certificates to enable HTTPS.
- **AWS IAM**: Configured granular access controls for services and resources.
- **AWS CloudWatch**: Enabled logging and monitoring to track website metrics and user traffic.

**Key Features:**

- **Serverless Architecture:** Achieved a highly available solution without maintaining web servers.
- **Cost-Optimization:** Utilized S3 with pay-per-use pricing, saving costs compared to traditional hosting.
- **Global Distribution:** Integrated CloudFront for caching and fast delivery across AWS edge locations.
- **Security:** Enforced HTTPS for secure communication and restricted access via IAM policies.
- **Custom Domain:** Managed DNS with Route 53 for seamless domain name resolution.
- **Logging and Monitoring:** Implemented CloudWatch for proactive monitoring and issue resolution.

**Outcome and Impact:**

- **Reduced Latency:** Achieved 99.99% uptime and fast content delivery across regions.
- **Improved Security:** Secured website with HTTPS and IAM policies to mitigate unauthorized access.
- **Ease of Maintenance:** Adopted serverless hosting, reducing operational overhead.
- **Scalable Solution:** Architecture automatically handles increased traffic with no manual intervention.

**Documentation & Resources:**

- **Architecture Diagram:** Available upon request (or hosted on GitHub).
- **Project Documentation:** Includes setup guide, AWS CLI commands, and cost optimization strategies.
